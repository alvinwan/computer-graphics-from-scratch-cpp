/*
Raycast 09 - Transparency
========================================
Adds support for transparency

```bash
g++ raytracer-09-transparency.cpp -o main.out -std=c++20 -Ofast
./main.out
open output.bmp
```

The original "Computer Graphics from Scratch" book doesn't contain a demo for
this additional functionality. The original description of the algorithm is in
the "Extending the Raytracer" chapter:
