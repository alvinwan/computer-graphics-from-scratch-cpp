# "Computer Graphics from Scratch" in C++
C++ implementation of demos from "Computer Graphics from Scratch"

To get started, pick any demo script to build. For example, the first demo for
raycasting is in `raytracer-01.cpp`. To build and run it, use the following

```bash
g++ raytracer-01.cpp -o raytracer-01.out -std=c++20
./raytracer-01.out
open output.bmp
```

This gives the following output, which matches the output from the corresponding
[demo on the author's website](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/demos/raytracer-01.html).
